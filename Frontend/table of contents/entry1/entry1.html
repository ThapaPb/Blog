            <p> Death is something that everyone wants to avoid. Even talking about it or having to read this line 
                that forces you to think about death and dying, makes you squirm. It's a heavy word; there are few 
                words that evoke such meaning that it jumps at you, even in reading it. It's like death has extra dimensions to it than other words, it seems our range of expression of death
                is vaster than for other words. Love is another such word. I don't have to say anything about love, if 
                i make you think about the word for longer than a few seconds, you'll add your own expression to it.
                <div class="thought-prompt">
                    <p>“Pause and consider: What is the first memory that comes to mind when you think of love?”</p>
                </div>
                Mine is of my mother, as I'm sure many of your first memories of love are of your mother. A mother's love, 
                especially as her children are still infanta, is very initimate. She grows you inside her body; you are part 
                of her. My first memories of love are of my mother chewing up solid foods and feeding it to me. As gross as 
                that sounds, apparently as a kid, I hated chewing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Maybe love and death do come in pairs. Death makes a worthy opposite to love, don't you think? I've always found 
                it difficult to pair hatred opposite love. It feels insignificant before love, I guess I don't have as many 
                experiences with expressions of hatred but I sure have felt love. Death perhaps could opposite love, yet love 
                is more powerful- it always outlasts death. 
                <br><br>
                Death of a loved one will definitely show you death. As a teenager, as I felt the full range of emotions for the
                first time, I felt very strongly about death. I had keepsake box where amidts my prized possessions of notes from 
                friends passed during class, birthday cards and tidbits of my "firsts", I had tucked away a peice of paper. This 
                peice of paper was my "in case of sudden death" paper, a teenager's hand scribbled will if you will. 
                <br><br>
                It's different, loving someone who no longer exists. But you notice, your love for them still goes on. You try 
                to bring them into your life through pictures, remnants of possessions and memories.  The weight around death is
                perhaps the pain that it brings with it. You know, pain is a beast. Think about what pain feels like- it's screaming at you. 
                Experiencing death but not dying brings with it pain. Nobody has a cherry disposition around the death of a loved one. 
                It has weight in emotions for everyone. 
                <br><br>
                I think I had a very difficut brush with death, but you don't know when it's happening to you. My mom died.
                She committed suicide a year after I left home. I was 20 years old and about to be sophomore in college. I had flown almost 8000 miles away from home. 
                Does everyone live this far away from home in our modern world? It's strange being so far away from home, everything 
                is different you know. There's very few things around you that reminds you of home. But it is pleasant enough, and you 
                live on, trying to make somewhere else home again. 
                <br><br>
                And then i got a phone call from my best friend, at work which was a 
                bagel shop.
                <br><br> It was summer and college was closed for the semester. I had decided to stay and work and pay off fees. It 
                was sudden you know, when you think suicide you expect that people around would have noticed something different that 
                would make death seem not unexpected. At the time, I had no idea what was going on. 
                <br><br> My best friend tells me that I should go home. I told her I just got to work, what does it mean that I should go home? I thought hmm maybe a strange 
                prank. Then she said I should call home right away. 
                <br><br>
                Panic set in, something was wrong. 
                <br><br> I pushed her, what is going on!
                <br> <br>My aunt called her, thinking she was still my roomate she told me. She said something happened to my mom. I checked my phone, 
                I had put in on silent before. Missed calls from my aunt and my best friend. One missed call from my grandfather from back home. 
                <br> <br>
                Something is very wrong, I can sense it before I know what is going on. It was strange. I had no idea what to think because 
                it wasn't something you could have discussed over the phone. 
                <br><br>
                I knew I had to buy some plane tickets and go home. Now.
