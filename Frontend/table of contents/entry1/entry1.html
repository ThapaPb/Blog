            <p>Death is something that everyone wants to avoid, even talking or having to read this line that forces you to think about death and dying, you want to avoid death. I t's a heavy word, that are few words that evoke such meaning that it jumps at you, even in reading it. It's like death has extra dimensions to it than other words, our range of expression of death is vaster than for other words. Love is another such word. I don't have to say anything about love, if i make you think about the word for longer than a few seconds, you'll add your own expression to it.
                <div class="thought-prompt">
                    <p>“Pause and consider: What is the first memory that comes to mind when you think of love?”</p>
                </div>

                Maybe love and death do come in pairs. Death makes a worthy opposite to love don't you think? I've always found it difficult to pair hatred opposite love. It felt insignificant before love, I guess I don't have much as many expressions of hatred but I sure have felt love. Death perhaps could opposite love, but love always outlasts death. Death of a loved one will show you death. But you notice, your love for them still goes on. You try to bring them into your life through pictures, remnants of possessions and memories. It's different, loving someone who no longer exists. The weight around death is the pain that it brings with it. You know, pain is a beast. Think about what pain feels like, it's screaming at you. Experiencing death but not dying brings with it pain. Nobody has a cherry disposition around the death of a loved one. It has weight in emotions for everyone. I think I had a very difficut brush with death, but you don't know when it's happening to you. My mom died, committed suicide a year after I left home. I was 20 years old and about to be sophomore in college. I had flown almost 8000 miles away from home. Does everyone live this far away from home in our modern world? It's strange being so far away from home, everything is different you know. There's very few things around you that reminds you of home. But it is pleasant enough, and you live on, trying to make somewhere else home again. And then i got a phone call from my best friend, at work which was a bagel shop. It was summer and college was closed for the semester. I had decided to stay and work and pay off fees. It was sudden you know, when you think suicide you expect that people around would have noticed something different that would make death seem sadly not unexpected. At the time, I had no idea what was going on. My best friend tells me that I should go home. I told her I just got to work, what does it mean that I should go home? I thought hmm maybe a strange prank. Then she said I should call home right away. Panic set in, something was wrong. I pushed her, what is going on! My aunt called her, thinking she was still my roomate she told me. She said something happened to my mom. I checked my phone, I had put in on silent before. Missed calls from my aunt and my best friend. One missed call from my grandfather back home. Something is very wrong, I can sense it before I know what is going on. It was strange. I had no idea what to think because it wasn't something you discussed over the phone. I knew i had to buy some plane tickets and go home now.
