My mother died that summer. She <span className=\"bold-italic\">took her own life</span>, one year after I left home. I was <span className=\"highlight\">thousands of miles away</span>, an ocean and a continent stretched between us, and in the blink of an eye, that distance became eternal.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                The modern world allows us to <span className=\"italic\">scatter across the globe</span>, each of us building lives far from where we began. But the price of that distance, of living so far from home, is that the places and people you love are reduced to voices on a screen, memories wrapped in pixelated images. It’s a strange kind of existence, comforting in its distractions, until something happens to shatter that illusion.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                It was a bright, ordinary day at the bagel shop where I worked. The kind of day that fools you into thinking life is steady and safe. Then my best friend called, and in her voice, I heard something that froze me, a stillness that prickled my skin. She told me I needed to go home. Her words didn’t make sense. <span className=\"italic\">Go home?</span> I was at work, everything was fine. I almost laughed at the absurdity. But her tone turned urgent, and the ground beneath my feet began to shift.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                “Call home, <span className=\"italic\">right away</span>,” she said, her voice tight, as though holding back a truth too heavy to bear.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                I remember that moment as if in slow motion. The sounds around me faded, leaving only the frantic beat of my heart. I checked my phone—missed calls from my aunt, my grandfather, my best friend. My mother’s name was absent, and in that silence, I understood. The world around me shrank, became surreal, like a landscape seen through fogged glass.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                I knew, even before I knew. Some part of me understood that I was about to cross a threshold from which there was no return. There are certain moments in life when you feel the veil between worlds thin, when the ordinary cracks open to reveal a glimpse of something infinite, something sacred and terrifying. I was caught in that liminal space, standing on the precipice of <span className=\"italic\">loss and love</span>, with nothing to hold onto but fragments of the life I had known.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                There is a quiet wisdom in tragedy, a kind of knowing that only reveals itself in the stillness that follows. In the days that would come, I would return home, walk through the familiar rooms that now felt foreign, haunted by her absence. I would search for her in the spaces where she once was, only to find echoes, traces, the faint scent of her perfume clinging to the air. And I would learn, painfully and beautifully, that love is not bound by time or space. It endures, like light from a distant star, reaching us long after its source has disappeared.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                And in that enduring love, I found a strange solace. <span className=\"highlight\">Death may take, but love gives</span>. It is the bridge that spans life and death, a thread that binds us across worlds. There is something eternal in love—a spark of divinity, perhaps—that no amount of darkness can extinguish.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                As I bought my ticket home, the tears and panic finally setting in, I knew that my life was no longer the same. I was embarking on a journey not just back to where I had come from, but into the depths of what it means to <span className=\"italic\">love and lose</span>, to live with the weight of absence, and to find, even in the darkest moments, a glimmer of hope.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            {/* Navigation Buttons */}\r\n            <div className=\"navigation-buttons\">\r\n                <button
