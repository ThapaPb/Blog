My earliest memory of love is of my mother, chewing food until it was soft, then feeding it to me, bridging the worlds of her body and mine. I was part of her; she was part of me. Her love was not taught; it simply was. Such love is primal, ancient, as close to the essence of life as we can reach.

Death, though\\u2014death was a more fitting opposite. And yet, even in that pairing, love somehow prevailed. Death may close the door, but love keeps it ajar. It lingers, reaching through the veil. Love always outlasts death. When someone you love dies, you don\\u2019t stop loving them. Instead, you find yourself loving them in their absence, drawing them back through photos, fragments of memories, the echo of laughter that hangs in the air long after they\\u2019re gone. Death doesn\\u2019t end love; it changes its form. The weight around death is not just its finality but the aching beauty of love that remains. And with that love comes pain\\u2014a beast that roars and claws, demanding to be felt, refusing to be ignored. The summer before my sophomore year in college, I had what I can only describe as a profound brush with death. But the strange thing about such encounters is that you don\\u2019t recognize them as they unfold. Only afterward, in the stillness, do you realize what\\u2019s changed, what\\u2019s been broken open within you. My mother died that summer. She took her own life, one year after I left home. I was thousands of miles away, an ocean and a continent stretched between us, and in the blink of an eye, that distance became eternal. The modern world allows us to scatter across the globe, each of us building lives far from where we began. But the price of that distance, of living so far from home, is that the places and people you love are reduced to voices on a screen, memories wrapped in pixelated images. It\\u2019s a strange kind of existence, comforting in its distractions, until something happens to shatter that illusion. It was a bright, ordinary day at the bagel shop where I worked. The kind of day that fools you into thinking life is steady and safe. Then my best friend called, and in her voice, I heard something that froze me, a stillness that prickled my skin. She told me I needed to go home. Her words didn\\u2019t make sense. Go home? I was at work, everything was fine. I almost laughed at the absurdity. But her tone turned urgent, and the ground beneath my feet began to shift. \\u201CCall home, right away,\\u201D she said, her voice tight, as though holding back a truth too heavy to bear. I remember that moment as if in slow motion. The sounds around me faded, leaving only the frantic beat of my heart. I checked my phone\\u2014missed calls from my aunt, my grandfather, my best friend. My mother\\u2019s name was absent, and in that silence, I understood. The world around me shrank, became surreal, like a landscape seen through fogged glass. I knew, even before I knew. Some part of me understood that I was about to cross a threshold from which there was no return. There are certain moments in life when you feel the veil between worlds thin, when the ordinary cracks open to reveal a glimpse of something infinite, something sacred and terrifying. I was caught in that liminal space, standing on the precipice of loss and love, with nothing to hold onto but fragments of the life I had known. There is a quiet wisdom in tragedy, a kind of knowing that only reveals itself in the stillness that follows. In the days that would come, I would return home, walk through the familiar rooms that now felt foreign, haunted by her absence. I would search for her in the spaces where she once was, only to find echoes, traces, the faint scent of her perfume clinging to the air. And I would learn, painfully and beautifully, that love is not bound by time or space. It endures, like light from a distant star, reaching us long after its source has disappeared. And in that enduring love, I found a strange solace. Death may take, but love gives. It is the bridge that spans life and death, a thread that binds us across worlds. There is something eternal in love\\u2014a spark of divinity, perhaps\\u2014that no amount of darkness can extinguish. As I bought my ticket home, the tears and panic finally setting in, I knew that my life was no longer the same.
